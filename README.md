# Expo CLI Unexpected Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, error encountered when using the Expo CLI: "An unexpected error occurred". This vague message often stems from problems within the project's dependencies or their configuration.

The `expoBug.js` file shows an example of a project with potential issues (e.g., missing or conflicting dependencies).  The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides solutions for resolving the error.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check `package.json`:** Carefully review your `package.json` file, paying close attention to the dependencies.  Are all dependencies correctly listed and are their versions compatible?
2. **Reinstall Packages:**  Delete `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and then reinstall your packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:**  Use `npm ls` or `yarn why <package-name>` to investigate dependency conflicts.  You might need to adjust package versions or select specific dependency resolutions.
4. **Update Expo CLI:**  Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI by running `expo upgrade`.
5. **Clean `node_modules`:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages to resolve any corruption.
