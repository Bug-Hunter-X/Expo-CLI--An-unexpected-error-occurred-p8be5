The solution involves systematically addressing the potential causes outlined in the bug report.  Here's how you can resolve the issue:

1. **Verify `package.json`:**  Ensure all dependency names and versions are correct and compatible.
2. **Clean Installation:** Delete `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get a fresh installation of your dependencies.
3. **Check for Conflicts:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to examine the dependency tree and identify potential conflicts.  You might need to resolve the conflict by specifying version ranges or choosing alternative packages.
4. **Update Expo CLI:** Run `expo upgrade` to update the Expo CLI to the latest version. This can often fix unexpected errors related to CLI compatibility.
5. **Restart your machine:** A simple reboot may resolve temporary operating system issues that interfere with the installation process.

Example of fixing a missing dependency in `package.json`:
```json
// Incorrect package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0"
  }
}

// Corrected package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "expo": "^48.0.0" //Add missing Expo dependency
  }
}
```
